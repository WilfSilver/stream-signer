# Streamed Video Signer

This is a dissertation project based on creating a system for signing and
verifying streamed video, which allows for embedded "quotes" to keep their
signature while cryptographically preventing abuse.

For documentation, please see [stream-signer.wilfsilver.co.uk](https://stream-signer.wilfsilver.co.uk).

## Specification

A rough and basic specification is provided in [./spec.md](./spec.md),
however this is only used as a basis to plan the implementation itself
